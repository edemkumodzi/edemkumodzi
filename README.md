# Hi, I'm Edem Kumodzi ðŸ‘‹

**Software Craftsman**

I approach software development as a craftâ€”where every line of code is an opportunity to express intention clearly. I believe in building systems that are not just functional, but elegant, maintainable, and thoughtfully designed.

## What I Do

- **System Architecture**: Designing scalable, maintainable systems and APIs
- **Technical Advisory**: Guiding technical decisions and architectural choices
- **Software Engineering**: Crafting clean code in Ruby, JavaScript, and C#

## Philosophy

The best solutions often emerge from thoughtful constraints. Whether it's removing unnecessary code or designing elegant APIs, I'm always seeking clarity and purpose in technical decisions.
